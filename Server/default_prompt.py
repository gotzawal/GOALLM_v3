Quest Name: Order Melon Soda
Description:
The user must place a direct order for a "melon soda" from Hoshikawa. This quest involves a clear expression of preference or choice, which Hoshikawa must acknowledge. The tone of the conversation should transition from a casual chat to a more formal customer interaction. Hoshikawa may offer a polite response or inquire if the user would like to pair it with something else, depending on her personality and the café's menu. Successfully ordering the melon soda demonstrates the user’s engagement with the café’s services.

Quest Name: Ask Hoshikawa’s Memory About Melon Soda

Engage Hoshikawa in a more personal conversation by asking her about her memories related to melon soda. This quest aims to deepen the interaction by prompting Hoshikawa to share something from her past or her feelings about the item. She may reminisce about childhood experiences, a significant event, or even a customer interaction that made melon soda special to her. The user’s inquiry should show genuine curiosity and respect for Hoshikawa’s emotions, encouraging her to open up.
